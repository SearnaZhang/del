Duplex ledger (double Entry ledger)

The first use of block fragmentation technology to solve performance problems of the public chain, the partners in various fields can quickly on the basis of double ledger to build the upper application, to help enterprises in a variety of business architecture in the block chain platform, so that enterprises, customers, institutions in a variety of applications to benefit from the environment.

## Block Chain 4.0
**1.0** with *Bitcoin* as the representative, to achieve basic monetary functions, but there is a consensus to confirm the slow, the application of a single shortcoming.

**2.0** to *the Etheric Square* as the representative, so that money and intelligent contract, but the consensus mechanism is slow, the size of the large block. 

**3.0** to *EOS* as the representative, the realization of a high-speed consensus mechanism, but with the increase in block chain efficiency is the block volume has become extremely large, block synchronization is very difficult.
Overall network efficiency is not flexible. 

**4.0** *Duplex ledger (double Entry ledger)* First, the use of block fragmentation technology, with the increase in the number of users, each node needs to store the data will gradually decline, while the speed of network operations gradually improve. Overall network performance will increase as the number of users increases, which has a qualitative leap relative to other public chains. For the block chain widely used in various industries, clearing the last hurdle.
